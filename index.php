    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        It took me a while to find what I really wanted to do with my life, but it happened when I chanced upon computer
        programming.  It was challenging to learn at first, but that was part of the enjoyment and I love to create applications
        using different programming languages.
    </p>
    <p>
        Learning began with a DevOut bootcamp, where we learned how to code using C#, working on individual and group
        projects.  After that, I went back to school and am now completing my bachelor's degree in software development.
    </p>
    <p>
        Graduating next year, I am looking forward to putting my new-found skills to use developing a wide variety of applications
        for my clients.
